# Data Cleaning Processes with SQL - Nashville Housing Data

This repository contains a set of SQL scripts and guidelines for cleaning and preparing Nashville housing data. The goal of this project is to provide a step-by-step process for cleaning and transforming raw data into a more structured and usable format.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Nashville housing data, which includes information about various properties in Nashville. The raw dataset may contain inconsistencies, missing values, and other data quality issues that need to be addressed before performing further analysis or building predictive models.

## SQL Scripts

The repository includes the following SQL scripts:

1. `Data Exploration`: This script provides an overview of the dataset by exploring its structure, column types, and data quality issues.

2. `Data Cleaning`: This script focuses on cleaning the data by handling missing values, standardizing formats, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistent values.

3. `Data Transformation`: This script covers the transformation of the cleaned data into a more structured format. It includes tasks such as creating derived variables, aggregating data, and performing any necessary calculations.

4. `Data Validation`: This script validates the cleaned and transformed data by checking for any anomalies or inconsistencies. It ensures that the data meets the required quality standards.

5. `Data Export`: This script demonstrates how to export the cleaned and transformed data to a new table or file format for further analysis or sharing with others.

## Usage

To use these SQL scripts, follow the steps below:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. Set up a database environment with a SQL server that supports the scripts (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.).

3. Import the raw Nashville housing data into your database.

4. Open each script in a SQL editor or client of your choice.

5. Modify the script if necessary, such as changing table or column names to match your dataset.

6. Run each script sequentially, following the order mentioned above.

7. Review the output and log files to ensure that the data cleaning and transformation processes were successful.

## Dependencies

These SQL scripts assume that you have a working knowledge of SQL and have access to a SQL server or database environment. Additionally, you need to have the raw Nashville housing data available in a format that can be imported into your database.
